# Document Events

## useFrappeDocumentEventListener

### Hook for listening to document events

The hook will automatically subscribe to the document room, and unsubscribe when the component unmounts.
The hook listens to the following events:
- `doc_update`: This is triggered when the document is updated. The callback function will receive the updated document.
- `doc_viewers`: This is triggered when the list of viewers of the document changes. The hook will update the viewers state with the list of viewers.
